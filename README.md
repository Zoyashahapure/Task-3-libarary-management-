Library Management System
This Library Management System is a console-based Java application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates the basic operations of a library, such as managing books and users, borrowing and returning books, and displaying available books.

‚úÖ Key Highlights:
Modular Design: Implemented using multiple Java classes (Book, User, Library, and Main) to ensure a clean, organized structure.

OOP Concepts Used:

Encapsulation: Each class manages its own data and methods.

Abstraction: The internal logic of borrowing, returning, and managing users is abstracted in the Library class.

Object Creation: Real-world entities like Book and User are modeled as objects.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
Java ‚Äì Core programming language

VS Code ‚Äì Code editor for writing and compiling Java code

Terminal ‚Äì For running and testing the application
